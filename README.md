# Prolog---London-Underground
ASSIGNMENT – PROLOG IMPLEMENTATION  
The topic is Prolog implementation of 'London Underground' - choose a subset (10-20
stations) of the Underground, large enough for interesting queries (e.g. getting station A to B,
with minimum time or fewest changes - the times can be estimated, or use the TFL journey
planner for accurate times). In order to attain the highest mark, you should attempt either 1)
or 2), but note that 2) is much more difficult, so only attempt if you are very confident.

1) Implement AI search schemes for the London Underground, other than the default Prolog
search. (see Bratko 4th edition chapters 11,12,13)

2) As an alternative to 1), implement Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) for the predicate
‘path’ (see Bratko 4th edition fig 21.9 and chapter 21.3.4)

It is expected that the final report will be 9-12 pages, but you can use appendices for
any additional detail you deem appropriate.
